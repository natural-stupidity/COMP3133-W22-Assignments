# COMP 3133 Assignments
### Year: 2022
A folder of the two projects we were tasked with making for COMP 3123 (Full Stack Development II) at George Brown College. 

The application was made to allow users to book venues for events Both projects were linked together throughout the term. The first project was the back end and the second assignment was the front end.
The entire program is an estate rental application kind of. The program allows users to create accounts, log in, book venues, and view their bookings. Admin users are allowed to add listings to the program.

## Technical Details:
**Front End:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular<br/>
**Back End:**  MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, GraphQL


## How to Run:
1. Open the `.sln` (Project Solution) file located in each of the folders for the program.
3. From there, all you should need to do is run each program. You may need to build the project first.
    - Be sure to run Assignment 1 first as that's the backend, then run Assignment 2 through React (navigating to the folder and using `npm start` in a command line. You may have to update a few things).
